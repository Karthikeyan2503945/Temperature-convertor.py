## Features

-> Convert between:

  **Celsius → Fahrenheit / Kelvin
  **Fahrenheit → Celsius / Kelvin
  **Kelvin → Celsius / Fahrenheit

-> Automatically saves each conversion to conversions.txt
-> User-friendly text-based interface
-> Handles invalid input safely

## How It Works

The program:
1. Asks the user for a temperature value
2. Asks which scale to convert from (C/F/K)
3. Asks which scale to convert to (C/F/K)
4. Prints the result
5. Saves it in the format:
   *100 C -> 212.00 F
6. Asks the user if they want to perform another conversion

## Technologies used 
*Python 3 – main programming language.

*OOP (Classes) – used to organize tasks and the to-do list.

*JSON File Handling – stores all tasks in tasks.json.

*Datetime Module – manages and sorts due dates.

*Control Structures – loops, conditionals, and user input handling.

*Command-Line Interface (CLI) – simple text-based menu system.
